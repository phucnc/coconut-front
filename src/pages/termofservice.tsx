                                  law. conteNFT has always exercised judgment in allowing or disallowing certain assets, listings,
                                  smart contracts, and collections consistent with the spirit of openness in a worldwide community
                                  of users of a radical new technology. We carefully consider the complete situation and all its

                                  smart contracts, and collections when we discover them or they are brought to our attention.
